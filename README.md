DOM stands for Document object module <br>

Document object is a built in object that has many properties and methosd that we <br>
can use to manipulate the content <br>
the structure ,the style of the project <br>

this ability to manipulate the DOM or document object model is the most <br>
unique and useful abilities in javascript <br>

so almost anytime a website perfoms an action such as toggling a navigation menu <br>

or rotaing between slide show images or even dispalying an error <br>

when user tends to submit an incomplete form <br>

this is a result of javascript accessing and manipulating the DOM <br>

now another way of thinking of the DOM is thinking of it as atree of nodes <br>

like the above <br>

DOM object is actually property of window object <br>

which is a global top level object reperesenting a tab in the browser <br>

and this window object has access to information such as toolbars <br>

height and width of the window <br>

most of the node in the above diagram have praent child relationship <br>

the topmost node is the document node here and is the root node of the DOM tree <br>


which we access to DOM and manipulate all the content <br>

now this document node has one child node which is HTML <br>


nad html is the parent to head and body element <br>

now head and body elemts what we called is sibling <br>

since they rae on the same level of the DOM tree <br>

underneath the head elmt is what is the title element <br>

body element is the parent of paragraph and h1 <br>

paragraph and h1 are siblings to each other <br>


text content s inside each of these elemts are child node <br>
