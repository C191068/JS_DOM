# Intro

DOM stands for Document object module <br>

Document object is a built in object that has many properties and methosd that we <br>
can use to manipulate the content <br>
the structure ,the style of the project <br>

this ability to manipulate the DOM or document object model is the most <br>
unique and useful abilities in javascript <br>

so almost anytime a website perfoms an action such as toggling a navigation menu <br>

or rotaing between slide show images or even dispalying an error <br>

when user tends to submit an incomplete form <br>

this is a result of javascript accessing and manipulating the DOM <br>

now another way of thinking of the DOM is thinking of it as atree of nodes <br>

like the above <br>

DOM object is actually property of window object <br>

which is a global top level object reperesenting a tab in the browser <br>

and this window object has access to information such as toolbars <br>

height and width of the window <br>
